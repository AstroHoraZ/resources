<h2>Vedic Astrology Fundamentals: Planets, Houses, Nakshatras, Yogas</h2>

  <p>
    The cosmos deeply influences our lives, starting with the nine grahas (planets) in Vedic astrology: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu. Each one governs different aspects‚ÄîSun (vitality, leadership), Moon (emotions, mind), Mercury (communication), Jupiter (wisdom), Venus (love), Saturn (discipline), Rahu (ambition), Ketu (spirituality)‚Äîand their placement in your birth chart shapes your character and destiny :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. The twelve houses further specify life domains: the 1st house relates to self and health, the 7th to marriage and partnerships, the 10th to career, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
  </p>

  <p>
    Adding nuance, the 27 <a href="https://medium.com/@designersjubilant/significance-of-27-nakshatras-cd9012c7a710">Significance of 27 Nakshatras</a> refine astrological timing‚Äîeach Nakshatra spans ~13¬∞20‚Ä≤ of the ecliptic, broken into four padas, and rules major life periods and energy patterns :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Nakshatras are central to dasha systems that reveal age-related life themes based on the Moon‚Äôs placement at birth :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yogas are powerful planetary combinations in a chart that create special potentials. For example, ‚ÄúYoga-karakas‚Äù are planets that significantly influence career (10th house), such as Jupiter, Sun, Mercury, and Saturn :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. A strong Sun‚ÄëJupiter conjunction can bring wealth and leadership, while Mercury‚ÄëVenus combos enhance creativity and business skills :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
  </p>

  <p>
    Timing tools like <a href="https://medium.com/@designersjubilant/prashna-kundli-get-instant-answers-with-horary-astrology-2b3d748af88b">Prashna Kundli & Horary Astrology</a> allow astrologers to chart the moment a question is asked, predicting outcomes based on current planetary positions. Combined with yogas and nakshatras, this method offers real-time cosmic insight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Altogether, with the interplay of planets, houses, nakshatras, and yogas‚Äîplus techniques like birth-chart (Janam) analysis, horary (Prashna), and dasha timing systems‚ÄîVedic astrology presents a comprehensive toolkit for interpreting personality, relationships, career, and life events.
