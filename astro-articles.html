  <h2>Numerology and Compatibility Tools</h2>
  <p>
    Numerology offers a fascinating lens through which we can interpret life’s patterns, and

    is a great entry point. This tool compares two distinct systems of numerology to help users determine their most fortunate numbers.

<h2>Vedic Astrology Fundamentals: Planets, Houses, Nakshatras, Yogas</h2>

  <p>
    The cosmos deeply influences our lives, starting with the nine grahas (planets) in Vedic astrology: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu. Each one governs different aspects—Sun (vitality, leadership), Moon (emotions, mind), Mercury (communication), Jupiter (wisdom), Venus (love), Saturn (discipline), Rahu (ambition), Ketu (spirituality)—and their placement in your birth chart shapes your character and destiny :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. The twelve houses further specify life domains: the 1st house relates to self and health, the 7th to marriage and partnerships, the 10th to career, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
  </p>

  <p>
    Adding nuance, the 27 <a href="https://medium.com/@designersjubilant/significance-of-27-nakshatras-cd9012c7a710">Significance of 27 Nakshatras</a> refine astrological timing—each Nakshatra spans ~13°20′ of the ecliptic, broken into four padas, and rules major life periods and energy patterns :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Nakshatras are central to dasha systems that reveal age-related life themes based on the Moon’s placement at birth :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yogas are powerful planetary combinations in a chart that create special potentials. For example, “Yoga-karakas” are planets that significantly influence career (10th house), such as Jupiter, Sun, Mercury, and Saturn :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. A strong Sun‑Jupiter conjunction can bring wealth and leadership, while Mercury‑Venus combos enhance creativity and business skills :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
  </p>

  <p>
    Timing tools like <a href="https://medium.com/@designersjubilant/prashna-kundli-get-instant-answers-with-horary-astrology-2b3d748af88b">Prashna Kundli & Horary Astrology</a> allow astrologers to chart the moment a question is asked, predicting outcomes based on current planetary positions. Combined with yogas and nakshatras, this method offers real-time cosmic insight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Altogether, with the interplay of planets, houses, nakshatras, and yogas—plus techniques like birth-chart (Janam) analysis, horary (Prashna), and dasha timing systems—Vedic astrology presents a comprehensive toolkit for interpreting personality, relationships, career, and life events. Tools like <a href="https://medium.com/@designersjubilant/influence-of-planets-in-vedic-astrology-3ef496784661">Influence of Planets in Vedic Astrology</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@designersjubilant/yogas-in-vedic-astrology-391d922c386b">Yogas in Vedic Astrology</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@designersjubilant/12-houses-in-vedic-astrology-3332a2d9b4a8">12 Houses in Vedic Astrology</a> help distill these concepts into usable forms for self-understanding and decision-making.
